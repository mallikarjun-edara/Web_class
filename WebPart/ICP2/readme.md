<h4>Following the instructions by professor in the class and in the presented explanation video.This icp2 is stepping stone for the upcoming icp's in many ways.</br>
I have learnt about different elements in css such as headings,paragraphs,unordered list,ordered list ,div and span elements
And also various options for image and video using iframe and img elements
The vastness of the scripting such as css is observed and when it is combined with html,it is the main frontend design for any web application
I hope this lesson about different elemnts will help as basi =c foundation for my future application developent
